**Notes:**

* You can switch in between Rose and Rose2 by using the scrollwheel.
* Localization is __not__ implemented.
* The look/behaviour of the GUI may not be identical to the one found in the original PocoRose, This was not made to be a 1 to 1 copy of the original.
* I originally started working on this as a port for RAID and PD:TH, do not expect any updates on this repository in case the mod is broken.
